# Keycloak 2FA EMAIL Authenticator

This authenticator is derived from https://github.com/dasniko/keycloak-2fa-sms-authenticator. 
Instead of sms option it sends otp code to user email. You have to set up the smtp details in keycloak admin panel.


Please follow below video(s) on how to set up authentication properly:
